    "Q.5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "ANS:------>\n",
    "Multithreading is a powerful feature that allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single program. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Improved performance: By dividing a program into multiple threads, \n",
    "each thread can execute a different task simultaneously, which can lead to\n",
    "faster execution times and improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive even when \n",
    "one thread is blocked or performing a time-consuming task, as other threads can continue\n",
    "executing in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Resource sharing: Multithreading allows multiple threads to share resources such as memory,\n",
    "CPU time, and I/O devices, which can lead to more efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Simplified programming: In some cases, multithreading can simplify programming by dividing complex\n",
    "tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Increased complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to a program and can make it harder to debug\n",
    "and maintain. Synchronization and communication between threads can also be challenging to implement correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Resource contention: When multiple threads are accessing shared resources, contention for those\n",
    "resources can lead to performance issues and may require additional synchronization\n",
    "mechanisms to be put in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Deadlocks and race conditions: When multiple threads access shared resources\n",
    "without proper synchronization, it can lead to deadlocks and race conditions that\n",
    "can cause unpredictable behavior in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Overhead: Multithreading requires additional overhead to manage the threads, including\n",
    "thread creation and management, synchronization, and communication between threads. \n",
    "This can result in increased memory usage and reduced performance in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, multithreading can be a powerful tool for improving performance and responsiveness \n",
    "in a program, but it also comes with added complexity and potential pitfalls that must be\n",
    "carefully managed to ensure the correct functioning of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "ANS:------>\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions are common issues that can occur in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Deadlocks: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for\n",
    "the other to release a shared resource. This can happen when two threads each hold a \n",
    "resource and try to acquire the other's resource before releasing its own, causing both\n",
    "threads to become blocked indefinitely. Deadlocks can cause a program to hang or become\n",
    "unresponsive, and can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Race conditions: A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared \n",
    "resource simultaneously, and the final outcome depends on the order in which the threads execute.\n",
    "This can result in unpredictable behavior, as the output of the program may depend on the timing\n",
    "of thread execution. Race conditions can be difficult to reproduce and debug, and can lead to \n",
    "subtle bugs that are hard to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks and race conditions, it's important to use proper synchronization mechanisms\n",
    "when accessing shared resources in a multithreaded program. This can include using locks or \n",
    "semaphores to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, or using \n",
    "message passing to communicate between threads. It's also important to design the program\n",
    "carefully to avoid situations where multiple threads could become blocked waiting for each other, \n",
    "or where the order of thread execution could affect the outcome of the program.\n",
